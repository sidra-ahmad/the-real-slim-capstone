    "## PART II\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Aim\n",
    "My capstone project involves examining public proceedings and debates of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate during the Obama presidency through natural language processing. I am interested in comparing legislators' remarks during Obama's first term and second term and determining (1) whether there is a difference in the kind/sentiment of words spoken and (2) if it is possible to predict the passage of proposed legislation based on such a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to Consider\n",
    "1. Do Senators speak differently than Representatives?\n",
    "2. Do Republicans speak differently than Democrats?\n",
    "3. Does a party's minority/majority status affect the language its party members use?\n",
    "4. Does the quantity/type/sentiment of words used depend on seniority? gender? something else?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prosposed Methods and Models\n",
    "After building my datasets of extracted words and legislative information, I plan to employ unsupervised and supervised learning techniques such as clustering to identify common topics/themes among spoken remarks and some kind of tree-based classifier to predict a bill's passage/failure. My anticipation is that the clusters will represent both generalized policy areas (defense, fiscal, economic, and social) and more specific, contentious policy concerns (federal budget, national debt, defunding Planned Parenthood, the Affordable Care Act). In spite of my fondness for hierarchical aglomerative clustering, I will likely end up using k-means and perhaps give DBSCAN a shot as well. The latter is iffy because it requires so much tuning and may take up too much time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This immersive has convinced me of the power of tree-based methods, especially when those methods are random forest, extra trees, and boosting. My plan is to fit a baseline model of each to the data and subsequently optimize it using grid search to find the best parameters. The performance metrics upon which I plan to focus are the accuracy score, and cross validation score, precision and recall. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Risks and Assumptions\n",
    "One risk of this analysis is that the features might be all wrong: it might turn out that language has no bearing on a bill becoming a law or its significance might pale in comparison to that of other factors such as yay/nay votes as a consequence of partisanship and logrolling (trading votes). Although I want to restrict my analysis to debates about and remarks regarding specific pieces of legislation, it is possible that too few or too many observations were dropped, leaving me with a bad dataset. A related concern is rows with the title of ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS. Some legislators use these to recognize specific individuals, whereas others take this time to comment on a bill. It is going to take a lot of effort to separate the wheat from the chaff, so I'm going to keep all those observations and hope that substantive remarks will drown out the irrelevant ones. Another risk is the inclusion of filibuster speeches. While Ted Cruz reading Green Eggs and Ham on the Senate floor for his daughter might make for good television and a waste of everyone else's time, it adds noise to my model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning/Munging\n",
    "Unfortunately, I'm still stuck in this phase of my capstone. It took me a while to identify the best method for webscraping the Congressional Record (you would think that government would make this data easily accessible using an API), and the compilation of my dataset has yet to be completed. Years 2012 - 2017 have been scraped, converted to a DataFrame, then a CSV, and back to a DataFrame. Each of the columns has been changed into its proper type, preliminary cleaning has been performed on the text column, and I am currently in the process of dropping irrrelevant observations, which are composed of procedural/ceremonial actions such as reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, appointing the President Pro Tempore, and beginning each session with a prayer (seriously). Once the rows have been winnowed, features describing the word count and sentiment of each word will be generated. In terms of additional datasets, I plan to use ProPublica's Congress API to extract data on legislation and members of Congress.\n",
